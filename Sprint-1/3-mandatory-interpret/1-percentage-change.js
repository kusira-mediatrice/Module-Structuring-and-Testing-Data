// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made
//Reponse: there are 3 functions call in this file ;at lines 4&5 ReplaceAll and at line 10 log

// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?
//Reponse: the error is coming from line 5, because missing , in parameters list

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statement
//Reponse: lines 4&5

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations
//Reponse:lines 1,2,7&8

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?
//Reponse: carPrice.replaceAll(",", "")--> "10,000".replaceAll(",", "") -> "10000"
// Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) ---> Number("10,000".replaceAll(",", "")) -> Number("10000")
//this expression
